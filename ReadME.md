Southwick’s Responsive Website Project
This project is a responsive website including all skills learnt throughout the course so far. It advertises ‘Southwick’s’ family business that builds bespoke garden houses from scratch to finish. The website is very informative, easy to use for the appropriate demographic, and showcases the businesses portfolio, and reviews. It allows the user to get in touch with ease, is visually pleasing and competes well to other sites providing the same service. 
UX
This project is completely responsive on both a desktop and mobile. I need to add the bootstrap responsive columns still. I need to make sure the logo is smaller on mobile screens – I will ask my mentor for help with this. 
Features
•	Feature 1 – fixed nav on desktop --- ease of navigation
•	Feature 2 – Large font --- ease of navigation
•	Feature 3 – Forms are not yet fully functional, but will connect to the Southwick’s email. 
•	Feature 4 – hyperlinks on accreditation logos link to official page --- gives user more reviews and increases trust. 
Technologies Used

Testing
I still need to perform testing once the site is complete. 
Deployment
This website was creating using WebStorm IDE, a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded to GitHub. I need to make it live using Git pages.
