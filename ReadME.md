<h1>Southwick’s Responsive Website Project</h1>
This project is a responsive website including all skills learnt throughout the course so far. It advertises 
‘Southwick’s’ family business that builds bespoke garden houses from scratch to finish. The website is very 
informative, easy to use for the appropriate demographic, and showcases the businesses portfolio, and reviews. 
It allows the user to get in touch with ease, is visually pleasing and competes well to other sites providing 
the same service. 

<h2>UX</h2>
This project is completely responsive on both a desktop and mobile. I have hidden content on the 'building specs' page 
when the view is on mobile. 

<h2>Features</h2>

•	Feature 1 – fixed nav on desktop --- ease of navigation
•	Feature 2 – Large font --- ease of navigation
•	Feature 3 – Forms are not yet fully functional, but will connect to the Southwick’s email. 
•	Feature 4 – hyperlinks on accreditation logos link to official page --- gives user more reviews and 
increases trust. 

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

•	HTML
•	CSS
•	Bootstrap
•	Git
•	GitHub
•	WebStorm IDE
•	Google Chrome Developer tools

<h2>Testing</h2>

I still need to perform testing once the site is complete. 

<h2>Deployment</h2>

This website was creating using WebStorm IDE, a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded 
to GitHub. I have made it live using Git pages. 

<h2>Credits</h2>
