<h1>Southwick’s Responsive Website Project</h1>
This project is a responsive website including all skills learnt throughout the course so far. It advertises 
‘Southwick’s’ family business that builds bespoke garden houses from scratch to finish. The website is very 
informative, easy to use for the appropriate demographic, and showcases the businesses portfolio, and reviews. 
It allows the user to get in touch with ease, is visually pleasing and competes well to other sites providing 
the same service. 

<h3>UDX</h3>
This project is completely responsive on both a desktop and mobile. 

Please refer to my UDX folder for a deeper understanding. 

Added UDX features following writing my UDX files:
<ul>
<li>I have hidden content on the 'building specs' page 
    when the view is on mobile as it would be too much content and the reader probably won't read it.</li>
<li>I have used a Nav Bar toggle for tablet view and smaller, this is to decrease clutter and content overload for the user</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li><h5>Feature 1</h5> – fixed nav on desktop --- ease of navigation</li>
<li><h5>Feature 2</h5> – Large font --- ease of navigation</li>
<li><h5>Feature 3</h5> – Forms are not yet fully functional, but will connect to the Southwick’s email.</li>
<li><h5>Feature 4</h5> – hyperlinks on accreditation logos link to official page --- gives user more reviews and 
    increases trust.</li>
<li><h5>Feature 5</h5> - Review carousel next to form to increase the users confidence and excitment when enquiring for a survey.</li>
</ul>

</ol>

I have had feedback that the social links to do open. This is correct and due to the fact I have not received them yet from the business owner.
I will complete this before the website goes fully live. 

I have also had feedback that when opening the 'Click Here' PDF on the 'Meet the Team' page, under, 'Building regulations', 
that is does open a new browser but nothing shows on the PDF. I need to troubleshoot this problem and get another PDF sent from the 
business owner.

<h3>Deployment</h3>

This website was creating using WebStorm IDE, a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded 
to GitHub. I have made it live using Git pages. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' 
to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit
my changed files to the repository. Once my files were commited I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub
before making it live with Git pages. I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
